/** @ingroup creditcards

    @brief An abstract class for showing and saving configuration information
           for a specific credit card processor.

    Each credit card processing company has its own API and requirements
    for communicating with it over the Internet. The commonalities are
    encapsulated in the configureCC class. The ConfigCreditCardProcessor
    class abstracts a simple interface that configureCC can use to save
    the details specific to individual processing companies.

    Subclasses of ConfigCreditCardProcessor are expected to load the
    specific details in their constructors, present them in a UI for the user
    to view and change, and save these changes with the sSave slot.
